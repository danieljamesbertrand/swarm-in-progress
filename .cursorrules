## Non-negotiable rules (persistent memory)

1) Read and follow:
- `.cursor/rules/engineering_memory.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_GOAL_AND_BREADCRUMBS.md`

2) Do not break reproducibility:
- Use the pinned toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml`
- Do not delete/ignore `Cargo.lock`
- CI must pass: `cargo build --all-targets --locked` and `cargo test --locked`

3) PowerShell reliability:
- Avoid building command lines as strings; use argument arrays/splatting.
- Keep scripts parseable; CI runs parse + PSScriptAnalyzer.

4) Breadcrumb discipline:
- When changing behavior/protocol/routing/transport, append a breadcrumb entry in
  `docs/PROJECT_GOAL_AND_BREADCRUMBS.md` with what/why/how verified.

## Project goal (do not drift)

Encrypted JSON messaging over QUIC, weighted routing, and a distributed AI pipeline that
returns results reliably to the originating requester (request-id correctness, retries/timeouts).

# Fixed: HTTP 404 Error for /ai-console.html

## Problem
Accessing `http://localhost:8080/ai-console.html` returned HTTP 404.

## Root Cause
The `serve_static` function was not prepending the `web/` directory to file paths when serving files other than the root path.

## Fix Applied
Updated `src/bin/web_server.rs` to properly handle file paths:
- Root path `/` → serves `web/ai-console.html`
- Paths like `/ai-console.html` → serves `web/ai-console.html`
- Paths already starting with `web/` → used as-is

## Solution
**Restart the web server** for the fix to take effect:

1. Stop the current web server (close the PowerShell window or Ctrl+C)
2. Restart it:
   ```powershell
   cargo run --bin web_server
   ```

## Testing
After restart, these URLs should work:
- `http://localhost:8080/` → serves `web/ai-console.html`
- `http://localhost:8080/ai-console.html` → serves `web/ai-console.html`
- `http://localhost:8080/admin.html` → serves `web/admin.html`

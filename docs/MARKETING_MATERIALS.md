## Brand Overview

### The Story

**Prometheus** was the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity, enabling civilization to flourish. **Promethos-AI Swarm** follows this revolutionary tradition—taking the power of AI from centralized tech giants and distributing it to the people.

The **Swarm** represents our distributed network: thousands of nodes working together like a hive mind, each contributing to collective intelligence while being rewarded for their participation.

```
🧵 Thread: Introducing Promethos-AI Swarm

1/ 🔥 Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity.

Today, we're doing the same with AI.

Introducing Promethos-AI Swarm — distributed AI inference that pays YOU.

Let me explain 👇

---

2/ The Problem:

• OpenAI, Anthropic, Google control AI access
• Expensive subscriptions ($20-200/month)
• Your data feeds their models
• Censorship at their discretion

There has to be a better way.

---

3/ The Solution: A Swarm 🐝

Instead of one company owning AI:

• Thousands of nodes share the workload
• Each node hosts a piece of the model
• Your query is split across the swarm
• No single point of failure or control

---

4/ How it works:

📝 You submit a query
🔍 Kademlia DHT finds optimal nodes  
🧠 Shards process in parallel
⚡ Lightning-fast response
🔥 Nodes earn $FIRE tokens

All in under 500ms.

---

5/ For Users:

💰 Pay-per-query (100 sats = ~$0.06)
🔒 Privacy-preserving (distributed queries)
⚡ Instant via Lightning Network
🚫 Censorship resistant

No subscriptions. No data harvesting.

---

6/ For Node Operators:

🖥️ Run a shard node
🔥 Earn $FIRE for processing
📈 Passive income 24/7
🏛️ Governance rights

Your GPU finally pays for itself.

---

7/ The Tech Stack:

• 🦀 100% Rust
• 🔗 Kademlia DHT (like BitTorrent)
• ⚡ Lightning Network payments
• 🧠 Llama model sharding
• 📡 libp2p networking

Fully decentralized. Fully open source.

---

8/ Token: $FIRE 🔥

• Earned by nodes for work
• Spent by users for queries
• Staked for governance
• Burns on network fees

"Fuel for the Swarm"

---

9/ Roadmap:

Q1 2025: Testnet launch
Q2 2025: Mainnet + Lightning
Q3 2025: $FIRE token launch
Q4 2025: Mobile apps + enterprise API

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PROMETHOS-AI SWARM LAUNCHES: 
DECENTRALIZED AI INFERENCE NETWORK PAYS USERS TO CONTRIBUTE COMPUTE

[City, Date] — Promethos-AI Swarm, a groundbreaking distributed artificial 
intelligence network, announced today the launch of its public beta. The 
platform enables users to access AI inference at pay-per-query rates while 
allowing node operators to earn cryptocurrency rewards for contributing 
computing resources.

"Just as Prometheus brought fire to humanity, we're bringing the power of AI 
to everyone," said [Founder Name], CEO of Promethos Labs. "No subscriptions, 
no data harvesting, no censorship. Just open, distributed intelligence."

KEY FEATURES:
• Pay-per-query pricing starting at $0.06
• Node operators earn $FIRE tokens for processing
• Lightning Network integration for instant payments
• Fully open source, built in Rust
• Censorship-resistant architecture

The platform utilizes Kademlia DHT, the same technology powering BitTorrent, 
to distribute AI model shards across thousands of nodes globally. This 
approach eliminates single points of failure while enabling parallel 
processing for faster response times.

"The centralization of AI is one of the greatest threats to human autonomy," 
added [Founder Name]. "Promethos puts that power back in the hands of the 
people."

Promethos-AI Swarm is now accepting node operator applications and user 
registrations for its public beta at promethos.ai.

ABOUT PROMETHOS LABS:
Promethos Labs is building the infrastructure for decentralized AI. Founded 
in [Year], the team includes [X] engineers from [notable companies/projects].
